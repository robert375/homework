    <h1>Examples of Bedrooms</h1>
    <h2>Master Bedroom</h2>
    <section class="master"><img src="../pics/bedroom/175862060.jpg" alt="" height="200">The master bedroom gives adults
        a place to
        escape the
        stress and troubles of the day. Theyâ€™re generally the largest room in the home and often have an adjoining
        bathroom. Some are designed with sliding glass doors that lead out to a deck or patio where you can relax and
        have some privacy. From the classic to the modern design, the main things to consider are lighting, storage
        space and comfort.</section>
    <h2>Dorm Bedrooms</h2>
    <section class="dorm"><img src="../pics/bedroom/dorm-rooms.png" alt="" height="200">Most dorm rooms are small, but
        there are
        different types of dorms rooms. Single-sex dorms allow only the same gender for occupants and can have
        restrictions regarding visitors of the opposite sex. Special interest or themed dorms cater to students with the
        same interests. Suites consist of two bedrooms adjacent to a shared living space. Double dorms accommodate two
        people as roommates. Single dorm bedrooms are not as common but appeal to a private person.</section>

<h2>Teen Bedrooms</h2>
<section class="master"><img src="../pics/bedroom/img26l.jpg" alt="" height="200">Teens spend a lot of time in their
    bedrooms, so it
    needs to have
    an environment that reflects their personality. Most bedrooms for teens will have an area specified for work, such
    as homework. Sufficient lighting is important to provide the teen with a proper studying environment. A comfortable
    sitting chair for reading and studying is a nice touch. Adequate closet space and dressers are needed for personal
    belongings.</section>
