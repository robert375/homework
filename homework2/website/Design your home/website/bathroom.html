    <h1>Examples of bathrooms</h1>
    <h2>Full Bathroom</h2>
    <section class="full"><img
            src="../pics/bathroom/master-bathroom-design-ideas-4129362-hero-d896a889451341dfaa59c5b2beacf02d.webp"
            alt="" height="200">Full bathrooms have a toilet, sink, shower,
        and
        bathtub/shower
        combination or a separate bathtub or soaking tub and shower.

        Most homes will have at least one full bathroom. A full bathroom is versatile and valuable, packing many
        functions into a relatively small space. It is common for low- to mid-priced two-bedroom homes to have one full
        bathroom.

        When a house with multiple bedrooms shares one bathroom, designing that bathroom as a Jack and Jill bathroom
        makes the bathroom accessible to two of those bedrooms. A Jack and Jill bathroom has two doors that lead in and
        out of two bedrooms.</section>
    <h2>Three-Quarter Bathroom</h2>
    <section class="full"><img

            height="200">Half
        Bathroom
        Half-bathrooms have a toilet and a sink. Half-bathrooms are called powder rooms or guest bathrooms as often as
        they are called half bathrooms.

        Half-baths allow more privacy for the homeowner, as visitors can use the toilet and wash up without entering the
        bedroom areas. Also, since full bathrooms tend to be more personal spaces with garments and medicines, visitors
        never need to see those items.

        Since half-bathrooms are more for brief and limited use by visitors, they typically have only a minimum amount
        of storage space. An enclosed bathroom vanity cabinet is usually large enough to store the few cleaning items
        and toilet paper needed for the half bathroom.</section>
    <h2>Quarter Bathroom</h2>
    <section class="full"><img
            src="../pics/bathroom/large-white-shower-stall-80119693-8b246dc092a1475a99b9c7f78e2be3df-9fdd427b7b0b4c1ea99c169f5a3d9b46.webp"
            alt="" height="200">A quarter-bathroom is a small room that contains either a toilet or a shower stall.
        Quarter bathrooms
        are often called utility toilets or utility showers.

        Quarter bathrooms are not common. They are sometimes found in the basements or lower levels of older homes.
        These bathrooms would likely have been installed retroactively by the homeowner, not by the original builder.
        Quarter-bathrooms would provide a homeowner working outside or a handyman with a convenient toilet or shower,
        without having to walk through the house.</section>
